### 🎮 FizzBuzz Game Project  

Welcome to the **FizzBuzz Game Project**! 🧩 This is a **classic beginner's project** in C# that **many developers** work on when learning the language.  

I originally practiced **FizzBuzz** during my **studies at Lexicon**, but this version was built **entirely on my own** outside of school as an extra challenge. The goal of this project is to **improve the basic logic** and write a more professional version of the classic FizzBuzz problem.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Accepts user input to check numbers  
✅ Uses conditional logic to determine Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz  
✅ Displays the result dynamically  
✅ More professional structure compared to basic implementations

## 📝 Example Code Snippet (YAML)  

```yaml
FizzBuzzGame:
  InputNumber: 15
  Result: "Fizz Buzz"
  Rules:
    - "If divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'"
    - "If divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'"
    - "If divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'Fizz Buzz'"
    - "Otherwise, print the number itself"
```

This YAML snippet represents how the program processes input numbers dynamically.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** .NET  
- **Concepts:** Conditional Statements, String Formatting, User Input Handling

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/Evgallos/FizzBuzzGameProject.git
```  
2️⃣ Open the project in Visual Studio  
3️⃣ Run the application  

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements  
🔹 Add support for batch processing multiple numbers  
🔹 Implement a UI for a more interactive experience  
🔹 Expand functionality with additional game variations

This project was developed as an **independent exercise** outside of my Lexicon coursework, showcasing **problem-solving skills** and **C# logic structuring**.  

Enjoy playing **FizzBuzz**! 🎲🔥
